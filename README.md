# Scene Transitions Manager for Godot Engine

## Description
Autoload class to manage scene transisitons between levels. 

## Install
Copy /autoload to your porject. In project settings add global_manager.gd as an autoload file. 

## Usage
Considering your autoload was named GlobalManager:
```
GlobalMananger.goto_scene(<levelinfo:LevelInfo>, <transition:String>)
```
LevelInfo is a Resource under utility folder. It encapsulates level atributes like PackedScene path, level name, complete, etc. It can be freely cusmomized.
transition is an optional parameter. Default is a simple fade in and out rectangle.
In this project there are another examples: sonic_like.tscn and hole.tscn.

To implement a new transition, create a Control type scene that extends from SceneTransition (scene_transition.gd) and implements:
```
func get_animation_player()
```
- Returns the animationPlayer responsible for intro and out animations

```
func set_text(txt)  
```
Optional - The transition scene shows a text with the name of the level during transition.
